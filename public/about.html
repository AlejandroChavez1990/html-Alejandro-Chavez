<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alejandro Chavez and I am a Web Developer from Miami, Florida. My career journey didn't start with a passion 
  for web developing but instead started with me attending college to work on my Bachelor's Degree for Psychology. A couple of years 
after graduating, I decided to go back to school for my first passion which was audio. I attended a tehnical school and received 
a certification in Audio Engineering and graduated Salutatorian of my class and won an award for best audio and sound FX localization. </p>

<p>This began my career in Audio which spanned for the next six years as I worked as an audio engineer and Language Coordinator in a Dubbing Studio 
  in Miami. Throughout my time in this studio, I started gaining a passion for web developing and coding once I started working closely with the web developer
for the website the studio used daily for their operations. I helped integrate the website in the studios in Brazil but unfortunately was not too pleased 
with the process at the time. This made me a lot more curious about web developing as I wanted to create a better site for the company.</p>

<p>Now, I am starting my journey into web developing and I am very excited as to where this will take me and as to how I 
  can contribute to the world of web developing.
