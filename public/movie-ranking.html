<h1>Alejandro's Favorite Cinematic Adventures</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
An amazing mob story that spanned throughout 3 movies with the first installment being the best<br/> 
(in my opinion, of course). Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give legendary performances alongside James Caan<br/> 
and Diane Keaton.
</p>
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>
Another amazing performance by Al Pacino in which he plays a Cuban refugee just arrived to Miami in the 80's and<br/>
makes the world his by dominating the drug world.
</p>
<h3>The Naked Gun (All Three Installments)</h3>
<p>
In a total 180 from the previous 2 movies, The Naked Gun is an ridiculous slapstick style comedy by<br/>
The Zucker Brothers and stars Leslie Nielsen. Nielsen plays Lieutenant Frank Drebin who is the head detective for<br/>
Police Squad and gets into many hijinks during his investigations. Also, watch out for stupid jokes in the dialogue<br/>
that will definitely get a laugh out of you.</p>
